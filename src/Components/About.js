          I'm a software engineer from the Boston area. I previously have a
          background working with special needs adults. I have completed a
          Software Engineering bootcamp at General Assembly. I started my coding
          journey back in October 2018. I started taking some Python classes
          online and then decided to make it a career. I started at General
          Assembly in March 2019 and finished in June 2019.
